# Recovery-Strategy-Analysis-Project

## Overview
In the financial sector, banks often face the challenge of managing delinquent accounts, especially those that have been legally declared "uncollectable" and are classified as "charged-off." Despite this status, banks continue to seek ways to recover some of the owed amounts. This project explores how banks assign delinquent customers to various recovery strategies based on the anticipated recovery amount.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to evaluate whether the incremental recovery amount generated from assigning customers to a higher-cost recovery strategy justifies the additional expense. We will analyze whether the additional amount recovered exceeds the cost of implementing the more aggressive recovery strategy.
